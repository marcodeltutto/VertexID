#  Here is a summary of what this file is doing.

#  Initial File Contents:

#    - particle_sbndseg_tree
#    - cluster3d_sbndseg_tree

#
#   Operations performed:
#
#   Modifications:
#     - Cluster2D Threshold

#   Filters:
# 
#
#
#   Cluster2DThreshold: set a threshold level for semantic segmentation labels for individual particles
#
#   ThresholdTensor3D: set a threshold for tensors in 3D
#
#   Tensor3DFromCluster3D: Convert cluster3d objects into tensor3d objects (input to the 3D networks) - all pixels are converted in 3D.
#
#   CompressAndEmbed: Convert 2D images into uniform sizes across planes.
#
#   QSumFilter: Filter out nearly empty events in 2D by setting a threshold on charge summed in each plane.  Filters 2D and 3D labels.
#
#   EmptyTensorFilter: Filter out nearly empty events in 3D by setting a threshold on the number of non-zero voxels
#
#   EventPIDLabel: Create whole-event labels for Madeline's classification
#
#   ParentParticleSeg: Merge clusters in 2D and 3D into just their parent particles
#
#   Tensor2DFromImage2D: Convert the image data (and label data) into tensors for point net style input
#
#   LeptonSegLabel: Label the pixels as primary lepton (1) or non-lepton (2) or background pixels (0) (creates image2d)
#
#   LeptonSegLabel3D: Label the pixels as primary lepton (1) or non-lepton (2) or background pixels (0) (creates voxel3d)
#
#  This file runs in randomizing order, so feed files in any pattern as the output will be randomized.
